## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- HuggingFace API key (optional, the app works without it using the fallback system)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Healthcare-Chatbot.git
   cd AI-Healthcare-Chatbot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with your configuration:
   ```env
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here
   MODEL_NAME=google/flan-t5-base
   MAX_TOKENS=150
   TEMPERATURE=0.7
   APP_TITLE=AI Healthcare Assistant
   DISCLAIMER=‚ö†Ô∏è Always consult a healthcare provider for medical advice.
   ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
   ANALYTICS_FILE=usage_analytics.json
   ```
   
   Note: The HuggingFace API key is optional. If not provided, the system will use a built-in fallback mechanism to generate responses.

### Running the Application

Run the application with Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Chat
- Type your healthcare-related question in the input field
- Click the "Submit" button to get a response
- The chat history is preserved during your session

### Voice Input
1. Click the "üé§ Speak your question" button in the sidebar
2. Speak clearly when prompted
3. Your speech will be converted to text and added to the input field

### Document Upload
1. Use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload health-related documents
2. The content of the documents will be used to provide context for the AI's responses

### Export Chat
1. Click the "üì§ Export Chat" button in the sidebar
2. Download the chat transcript as a text file

### Toggle Theme
- Click the "Toggle Light/Dark Theme" button to switch between light and dark modes

## Response Generation

The application uses two methods for generating responses:

1. **HuggingFace Inference API** - If a HuggingFace API key is provided, the app will use the specified model to generate responses. This provides the most advanced and up-to-date responses.

2. **Fallback Response System** - If the HuggingFace API is unavailable or no API key is provided, the app will use a built-in rule-based system to generate responses for common healthcare topics. This ensures the app remains functional even without internet access or API keys.

## Important Notes

- **This is not a replacement for professional medical advice**
- The AI may not have access to the latest medical research
- Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns
- In case of emergency, call emergency services immediately

## Analytics

If analytics are enabled in the `.env` file (`ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true`), the application will log:
- Timestamp of interactions
- User inputs (for quality improvement)
- Response lengths
- User feedback

This data is stored locally in the file specified by `ANALYTICS_FILE`.
